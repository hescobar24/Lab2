        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <h2>What Makes Me Complex</h2>
        <p> Hidear is a man of many interests. He is from Boston and will ride and die for their sports; The Celtics, bascially.
            Art is very much a focal point within his life and it surrounds him at all times; it can be all he thinks about sometimes.
            He is very much a family and friends person, and for the most part that is the only group of people he is around.
